These documents have been developed by the Digital Research Environment Team at GOSH, working with a number of stakeholder groups from across the Trust to ensure that the process is useful while maintaining effective safeguards to mitigate risks of data breach and other risks associated with open publication.\nWhile a number of process / governance elements of this may not have direct equivalents in other NHS Trusts, it is hoped that this can provide a basis/inspiration from which to develop similar processes to support a culture of open publication in the NHS.\nPLEASE NOTE: although the ultimate aspiration for code development across the NHS would be that it be in an open coding framework, this process does not provide a basis on which to do this for work undertaken inside GOSH and based on patient data overseen by the Trust. We believe however that this is a significant first step for GOSH towards that goal, and that it will support further developments in that direction in the future."

The following papers fully document that process and the way we govern the use of open publication.\nChapter 4 describes the process by which candidate repositories can be reviewed, made ready for publication and published. This includes review by an “authorised approver” who works with the development team to ensure that the repository is ready for open publication. Our development process within GOSH uses an internal Gitlab instance, from which a snapshot - a “major version” - is taken for publication. Review is therefore undertaken internally before repositories are published to Github.\nChapter 5 is filled out for any project that will be openly published to ensure that considerations such as commercial relationships and IP are accounted for, and for reporting purposes."

It represents one of the cornerstones on which this strategy rests. We have developed a workable process that is acceptable to us as data professionals, our Information Governance Team and our ICT cybersecurity team, in order to safely and effectively openly publish our work - both documentary and code.\nChapter 3 is a transcription of the proposal that we took to our operational governance group, the Data Partnership Committee, for review and approval. This proposal was agreed subject to the creation of a duly authorised process for minimising the risk that published content might contravene our cybersecurity and governance responsibility within the Trust, and that a process was in place to mitigate risks to hospital systems, processes and data should such a data breach occur.\nWhile the proposal itself as agreed has some details on the process for open publication, these were superseded by a more formal and systematic standard operating procedure for open publication. This new more comprehensive process (Chapter 4) was authored in conjunction with our internal ICT and Information Governance teams."

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) review was made for open publication, but since the process itself intentionally excludes data processing (mechanisms are set up to prevent the incorporation of data into repositories) it was concluded that a full DPIA was not necessary.\nAll data/analytics projects undertaken at GOSH are authorised individually according to their nature, and in some circumstances this might require an approval or a DPIA, but open publication does not impact on the project authorisation process in any way."

    "text": "3.2 Introduction\nThe principle of open sharing of information within the NHS and beyond has been established at various levels, from government reviews down to specific agreement with the Data Partnerships Committee here at GOSH. The benefits of sharing intelligence, insights and best practice have been recognized therefore it is required that a workable process for implementing and overseeing open sharing is created. This process should balance the risks of dissemination of privileged and personally identifiable information (PPII), and risks around information security, against the benefits of providing and using openly shared resources with the rest of the NHS and the rest of the world.\nThe recommended route for open publication is via Github, a cloud-based Git repository hosting solution owned by Microsoft and available to be used for free, and this would be the intended target of every project openly published by the DRIVE team. The process for sharing works on the principle of “repositories” (or “repos”) which are project-specific sets of files (usually in a file structure identical to subfolders on a network drive) alongside a complete history of all those files, which can be selectively modified as required. This can be accessed by anyone on the Internet and the files are published with a permissive license allowing the use of the files for more-or-less any purpose and without any warranty.\nThis document will walk through the various protocols for open publication to be used in the Trust, and detail the steps and documentation required prior to open publication of any project within the team. This will ensure that repositories of documentation and code are published expediently while retaining suitable safeguards to mitigate any risks of inadvertent data sharing and/or of security-compromised code being deployed into the Trust. The following routes for publication:\n\nPublication at major versions,\n\nDocument publication,\nCode publication,\n\nOpen Coding (to be defined)."

    "section": "3.3 Open Publication (Major Versions)",
    "text": "3.3 Open Publication (Major Versions)\n\n3.3.1 Description\nOften, development of a body of work on a particular project (either documentation or code) occurs in phases of “drafting”, then review before finalization of a version, repeated multiple times – particularly when that work covers a number of topics/areas/requirements. This drafting process can contain content that requires review prior to publication. At each review, prior to finalization of a version, the content is checked for any privileged information or patient data, which is removed prior to version finalization. Open publication of this work in a repo therefore requires a robust review process, taking into account infosec requirements, and legal requirements regarding publishable content.\nIn this model of development and publication, the repo is only EVER pushed to the public repo. New versions are then merged into that pushed version. The repo is never pulled from that public repo and all development work occurs privately inside the GOSH network boundary according to our previously established development processes.\n\n\n3.3.2 Governance\nAll projects working towards repositories for open publication will be registered with the DRE Senior Leadership Team and a record will be kept as to decisions on publication. Please see Appendix 1 for the agreed registration form. For projects that are approved, repositories will be developed internally and published according to the below protocol. 1\nAudits of all code-based repositories will be undertaken on a quarterly basis, to ensure that malicious dependencies / vulnerabilities have not been identified in the repository. This audit will be presented to the Data Partnerships Committee (DPC) for review. This protocol will be reviewed annually to ensure that it remains fit-for-purpose and a report on its suitability and any proposed updates will be brought to the DPC for review and approval.\n\n\n3.3.3 Protocol\n\nRegistration: Projects with a component to be openly published will be registered and authorized as described above,\nDevelopment: All repository contents are developed in an internal repo (GOSH Gitlab) according to current internal code development processes and/or standard document drafting procedures within the Trust,2\n\n\nMajor version finalization: Prior to version finalization, all repo contents will be manually reviewed by a team member who did not develop the repo and any issues raised will be corrected and double-checked, 3\nOpen publication: The internal repo will “merged” into the corresponding open repo on Github (or a new repo as required) using the standard update process, 4\nReview: Openly available repos will be periodically audited as detailed above. 5\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Review Requirements6\nRepos containing either code or documents for publication require specific types of review, as detailed below.\n\nGeneral requirements:\n\nRepos must not contain any Personally Identifiable Information relating either to patients or to staff,\nRepos must not contain any “secrets” – passwords or API keys or other information that might expose the internal structure of ICT infrastructure in GOSH,\n\nCode Review Requirements:\n\nParts of code containing business/analytical logic must be covered by unit tests to provide assurance that the code works in the way that it says it works,\nCode must be free of known malicious dependencies, and\nCode must be suitably explained in a README file in the repo – detailing installation and use of the contents of the repo,\n\nDocument Review Requirements:\n\nDocuments must not contain privileged information – for instance business or clinically sensitive information or financial details relating to the Trust."

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nThis form should be filled out for a project being considered for open publication, open documentation or open sourcing within DRIVE. It sets outs a number of questions to consider, which will determine the suitability of that project for open publication. This form should be presented to the DRE Senior Leadership Team for review and acceptance before any project is published openly. All projects that are openly published in any way must adhere to software engineering best practices and the principles of Reproducible Analytics Pipelines where relevant – and be submitted to an authorized approver for final sign off.\nThe “Lead Contributor” should be the senior individual contributor on the project, who will take responsibility for adherence to best practice development and controls as set out in Chapter 4 (latest version available on request from DRE Support).\nIMPORTANT NOTE: review for open publication does not address ANY considerations around data management/IG; projects are still required to go through all relevant registration and approval processes (including DPIAs where appropriate). It remains the responsibility of the project Chief Investigator/Principal Investigator to ensure that all such documentation is in place and approved before open publication begins on a project involving real data processing."
